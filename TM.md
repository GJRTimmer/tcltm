# License
When using ```tcltm``` to build a Tcl Module it will scan the provided directory. If a LICENSE file is found it will be included as the LICENSE for the module.

***NOTE*** ```tcltm``` will remove all the first lines of comments from the Tcl source files.

# Header
Generate header meta data. Meta data keys are within the format ```KEY: VALUE```this can be used in the future to parse the meta information of a Tcl module.

# Init
Wihtin the ```.tcltm``` specification source code can be included within the ```yaml``` file by using the multiline indicator ```|-```.
Also a init script can be provided by specifiying a ```*.tcl``` file name.

# Source
Include Tcl source code.

Source code lines which matches the following expressions are stripped from the source. 
This only applies to included source, this is done because the ```tcltm``` generator will includes this
from the specification. This is however not applied to the initscript. The reason behind is that the initscript
is required to execute certain commands because of loaded libraries.

| Expression | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| ^package provide.* | Package provide state is generated by ```tcltm``` specification |
| ^package require.* | Package requirements are provided by ```tcltm``` specification |
